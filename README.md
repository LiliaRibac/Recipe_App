This project, developed during my Engineering Program at Chegg Skills, utilizes React for rendering and managing state. The purpose of this project is to provide a seamless and intuitive platform for users to manage and track their recipes efficiently. By leveraging React for rendering and state management, 
the app offers a smooth user experience while ensuring functionality and ease of use.

1. Users can add new recipes to the app.
2. The app displays a list of recipes for easy access and reference.
3. Users can effortlessly remove recipes from the list by clicking a delete button.
